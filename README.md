# Advent of Code solutions

Here lies the source for the programs developed to generate the solution for each day of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## 2023

My first AoC. Written exclusively in Rust to practice clean Rust code and, later, benchmarking and run-time optimization.

First few days had programs written as [Rust scripts](https://github.com/DanielKeep/cargo-script), before transition to [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc).

## 2024

Every few days, I'll use a different language. Some new, some old. Each with different goals.
